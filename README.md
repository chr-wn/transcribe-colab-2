# Audio Transcription Tool

A clean, simple command-line tool for converting audio files to text transcripts using whisper.cpp. This is a fresh implementation that integrates the original transcribe script functionality with modern whisper.cpp.

## Features

- **GPU-Accelerated Transcription** using whisper.cpp with CUDA support
- **3-5x faster** on Google Colab T4/A100 GPUs compared to CPU
- Support for multiple audio formats (MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, OGG, WMA)
- Batch processing of multiple files
- Timestamp support
- Multiple Whisper model sizes (tiny to large)
- **Optimized for Google Colab** with automatic GPU detection
- Same CLI interface as the original tool
- Automatic model downloading
- Progress indicators and detailed output
- Memory-efficient processing of long audio files

## Quick Start

### Local Installation

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <your-repo>
cd repo-2
./setup.sh

# Test the setup
./test_setup.py

# Basic usage
./transcribe.py audio.mp3
./transcribe.py -t audio.mp3  # with timestamps
./transcribe.py -m large audio.mp3  # use large model
```

### Google Colab (GPU-Accelerated)

**Important:** Set Runtime → Change runtime type → Hardware accelerator → GPU

```bash
# In Colab cell:
!git clone <your-repo>
%cd repo-2
!./colab_setup.sh  # Automatically detects and configures GPU

# GPU-accelerated usage:
!./transcribe.py -m large audio.mp3  # Large model is fast with GPU!
```

Or use the provided GPU-optimized notebook: `Colab_Transcription_Example.ipynb`

**Performance:** With T4 GPU, the `large` model transcribes a 10-minute audio file in ~2 minutes vs 8+ minutes on CPU.

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic transcription
./transcribe.py audio.mp3

# With timestamps
./transcribe.py -t audio.mp3

# Use different model
./transcribe.py -m large audio.mp3

# Custom output file
./transcribe.py -o transcript.txt audio.mp3

# Batch processing (separate files)
./transcribe.py *.mp3

# Concatenate multiple files into one output
./transcribe.py -b -o combined.txt *.mp3

# Verbose output with detailed info
./transcribe.py -v audio.mp3

# Help
./transcribe.py --help
```

## Models

Models are downloaded automatically on first use:

- `tiny` - Fastest, least accurate (~39MB)
- `base` - Good balance (default) (~74MB)  
- `small` - Better accuracy (~244MB)
- `medium` - High accuracy (~769MB)
- `large` - Best accuracy (~1550MB)

## Output Files

The tool generates output files with descriptive names:
- `audio.mp3` → `audio.txt` (basic)
- `audio.mp3` → `audio-base.txt` (with model name)
- `audio.mp3` → `audio-base-timestamps.txt` (with timestamps)

## Requirements

### Local Setup
- Python 3.8+
- CMake (for whisper.cpp compilation)
- C++ compiler (GCC/Clang)
- Git

### Google Colab
- No additional requirements (all dependencies installed automatically)

## Architecture

This tool:
1. Uses whisper.cpp as the transcription engine (not the Python whisper package)
2. Automatically builds whisper.cpp from source
3. Downloads models on-demand from Hugging Face
4. Provides the same user experience as the original tool
5. Works identically in both local and Colab environments

## Differences from Original Tool

- Uses whisper.cpp instead of faster-whisper/original-whisper
- Better performance and lower memory usage
- Simpler dependencies (no PyTorch required)
- More reliable GPU acceleration
- Faster model loading
- Better Colab compatibility
